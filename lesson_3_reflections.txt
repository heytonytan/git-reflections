When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am collaborating with people, or want to share my code with people around the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

This is because I would want to code based on that particular commmit, and even if the remote
repository has changes, I would want to commit to the version I had initially pulled.
